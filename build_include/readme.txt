New Star Trek LCARS themed MFD for Star Citizen 3.9.1
NOTES:

- The keybinding for 'HELMET' button needs to be set in game to the F9 key in order to work. There is no default binding for this action as of 3.9.1.

- If you've modified your keybindings, you'll need to switch back to the default template in the game settings.
